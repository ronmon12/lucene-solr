## Todo List
- [x] Clone lucene-solr project in my space and create new branch
- [x] Clone branch to local and setup IDE environment
- [ ] Understand Lucene410Codec and how to interact/test it with mock data
- [ ] Extend FilterCodec with a dummy StoredFieldsFormat
- [ ] Research embedded databases, choose one for the new codec
- [ ] Design new codec..... more details TBD

## Questions
* Is the codec extension only to store fields in an embedded database of my choosing, or is it to also incorporate new compression methods/libraries?
